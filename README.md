* GMSK Prototypes
    * Modulation 
    * Decoder 
    * Symbol synchronization
    * Frame detection
    * Channel Impaiments

The files contained in the `octave/` folder are part of the [codec2 low bit rate speech decoder](https://github.com/drowe67/codec2). All of the functions are copied from the fm.m and gmsk.m files of the project. They are used for GMSK encoding and decoding as well as testing and plotting.


* GMSK synchronization cpp implementation (WIP)
